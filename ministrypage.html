	<p>The Lighthouse is a ministry located at the heart of the Red Light District in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. It is estimated that there are over 25,000 women working in prostitution in the Netherlands*, many of them are victims of Human Trafficking.</p>

	<p class="quote">We are a group of lovers of Jesus whose eyes have been opened to the injustice in the city of Amsterdam and in the world.</p>
	<p class="source">Elisabeth Hamso, team leader.</p>

	<p>The Red Light District in Amsterdam consists of around 400 windows where women stand day and night selling their bodies for sex. This is just a small glimpse of injustice that we are confronted with as we walk the streets of the city.</p>

		<h3>Praying</h3>
		<p>We believe there is a battle and we fight it in with intercession, taking our stand in the spiritual realm. This is not battle of flesh and blood but against spiritual principalities. Because the district is most active at night, that’s when we gather together to pray. We do this by praying and worshipping in The Lighthouse (which is located in the RLD), prayer walking throughout the district, and studying the word of God together.</p>

	<h3>Reaching Out</h3>
	<p>From the foundation of being close to Him we reach out; seeking to walk as Jesus did without condemnation, but with a love that reflects who He is and brings people into knowing Him and knowing who they were created to be. Throughout the week we partner with Not for Sale and YWAM Amsterdam’s Evangelism Team.</p>

	<h3>Discipling the Ladies</h3>
	<p>Some women long to go deeper with God, we reach out to them by fellowshipping together over coffee or dinner, studying the Bible together, or just helping them in anyway they need.</p>
