	<h2>From Guttenberg to Google</h2>
	
	<p class="introductory">Loren Cunningham is an avid storyteller. Spending a large portion of his time travelling around the world he collects amazing stories of how God is moving globally. As he travels he shares his experiences and his wisdom with people, and we were lucky enough to steal some of his time as a base. He shared on the progression of the gospel in the modern world, starting at the 1400’s and going till the present day. And this is a bit of what he shared…</p>

	<p>Probably the biggest progression of Christianity and missions to this day was The Great Reformation. This is when individuals like Martin Luther, John Calvin and John Wycliffe, challenged the Roman Catholic Church on it’s teachings, doctrines and manipulation. This sparked a movement in society as a large number of people were in agreement.</p>

	<p>A huge contributor to the reformation happening was by a man named Johannes Gutenberg, who invented the first moveable type printing press in the mid 1400’s and actually began printing bibles as one of his first major projects. These bibles are known as Gutenberg’s 42line bible. This invention was a huge part of the reason the reformation was so successful.</p>

	<p>At this time most of Europe was illiterate but because of the printing press literature was more readily available. Through this people began learning to read and what do you know, the first things they were reading were pamphlets and works by Christian reformers. Information of this kind was spread quickly and widely, flooding Europe with the refreshed ideas on Christianity.</p>

	<p>In the 1500’s the statistics were that 1/69 people were followers of Jesus Christ, but fast forward to 1900 and that changed to 1/27 people, and even more recently in 2010 1/7 people.</p>
 
	<p class="quote">Defense will never win you a soccer game, you need offence as well. The offence of God was the bible being translated into the mother tongue of 36 languages for the first time in history.</p>
	<p class="source">Loren Cunningham</p>
 
	<p>So as the gospel spread people begun individually translating the bible into new languages and then even venturing to foreign countries as missionaries bringing the good news with them.</p>
 
	<p>The 500th anniversary of the reformation is coming up in 2017 and it’s incredible to see how the word of God is spreading more rapidly then ever before. The growth of Christianity is actually increasing faster than the growth of the population.</p>
 
	<p>Of the 6,800+ languages worldwide 469 languages have a complete Bible, and 2527 have some portions of the bible. But these numbers are continually changing as bible-translating organizations such as Wycliffe are working hard to have complete bibles printed and dispersed among every unreached community.</p>

	<p>It’s so vital that communities that have heard the gospel have access to a bible in their native language. Without this the chance of Christianity’s survival long term is unlikely. William Carey recognized the importance of this and made it his main priority to ensure that a foundation was built in communities incase they could no longer be reached for some reason.</p>
 
	<p>In modern times though the bible isn’t just being translated into book form, it’s in audio, in video, and it’s online!</p>
	<p>If you’re going to reach those under 35 you don’t hand them a bible, you send it to them online. You see we don’t have Gutenberg now, we have Googleberg.</p>
 
	<p class="quote">I believe in the 2020’s where I see a global transformation. I believe we have the transformation, I believe we have the potential now, to see in this generation that the knowledge of the glory of the Lord will cover the earth as the waters cover the sea.</p>
